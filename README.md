# 50.005 Machine Learning

## Introduction

This repo is a collection of all the assignments I've completed throughout the duration of the 50.005 Machine Learning module. It showcases the various concepts, algorithms that I've undertaken to better understand the field of machine learning.

## Homework Assignments

1. HW1: Perceptron, Linear/Polynomial/Ridge Regression
2. HW2: K-Means, K-Medoids, SVM, Kernel Methods
3. HW3: Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes
4. HW4: Gaussian Mixture Model, Bayesian Network

## Project

Details of the Machine Learning project can be found in another repo [here](https://github.com/ffeew/ml-sentiment-analysis-project).
